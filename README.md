# coffeeculator
okay okay yes I know what you're thinking; alembic
and sqlalchemy is overkill for a toy like this but
I wanted to be fancy

## current setup
if you wanna run this

1. create a venv
1. pip install the crap
1. `make local` which creates your db
1. `make run-alembic` will create the crap in the db

then a good ole `make brew` kick off the coffeeculator!

## todo list

1. actually calculate stuff?
